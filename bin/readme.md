# NOTICE

This package exports [phpjs](http://phpjs.org/) functions as Node.js modules.

Use it like:

    require('php.js/date')('Y-m-d H:i:s');

If you just need several functions and don't want to load the whole phpjs package.

Otherwise you should use [phpjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phpjs).
